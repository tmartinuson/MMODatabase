DELETE Operation
Implement a cascade-on-delete situation (or an alternative that was agreed to by the TA
if the DB system doesnâ€™t provide this).
Provide an interface for the user to specify some input for the deletion operation.

Warrior deletes their character/Cascades to PlayerCharacter

DELETE FROM Warrior WHERE ID = ?;

ON DELETE CASCADE TABLES
Completes
Assassin
Warrior
Mage






Selection
Create one query of this category and provide an interface for the user to specify the values of the selection
conditions to be returned.
Example:

SELECT ...
FROM ...
WHERE Field1 = :Var1 AND Field2 > :Var2

Selection of items held sold by the Shop

SELECT ItemID, Price, Stats
FROM Item_Equips_Sells as i
WHERE i.ShopName = ? AND i.LocationName = ?





Join
Create one query in this category, which joins at least 2 tables and performs a meaningful query, and
provide an interface for the user to execute this query. The user must provide at least one
value to qualify in the WHERE clause (e.g. join the Customer and the Transaction table to find
the names and phone numbers of all customers who have purchased a specific item).

Join Location and Shop_IsIn to find all shops that are located in a given location

SELECT ShopName, Type
FROM Shop_IsIn as s, Location as l
WHERE s.LocationName = l.Name AND s.LocationName = ? AND l.Name = ?







Aggregation with Having
Create one meaningful query that requires
the use of a HAVING clause, and provide an interface
(e.g., HTML 1 button/dropdown, etc.) for the user to execute this query.

Group Monster_isAt by location where each monster is having > 60 MonsterLevel (High Level)

SELECT Race, Type, MonsterLevel, LocationName
FROM Monster_isAt
GROUP BY LocationName
HAVING MonsterLevel > 60







Division
Create one query of this category and provide an interface (i.e.,
HTML button, etc.) for the user to execute this query (e.g., find all the 1 customers who bought all the items).

Which players has completed all locations

SELECT c.PlayerID
FROM Completes as c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
SELECT *
FROM Completes as c1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
SELECT *
FROM Completes as c2
WHERE (c1.LocationName = c2.LocationName) AND (c1.PlayerID = c2.PlayerID)))


deleteGivenWarrior(String playerID)
viewItemsInStockAtStore(String shopName, String location)
storesInLocation(String location)
strongMonstersByLocation()
completedAllLocations()

DELETE
Remains as the same query as before

deleteGivenWarrior()
DELETE FROM Warrior WHERE ID = ?

Selection
Select UsernamePlayer (Can't select since no longer prim key unless we join), PlayerID, Date and NPCName from Converses where Date is after 2020-01-01

SELECT PlayerID, converseDate, NPCName FROM Converses WHERE converseDate > '2020-01-01'

JOIN
Join PLayerXPLevel and PLayerCharacter tables to find the levels of all players who are under level 25

SELECT p.ID, p.Username, xp.PlayerLevel FROM PlayerXPLevel as xp, PlayerCharacter as p WHERE xp.XP = p.XP AND xp.PlayerLevel < 25

Aggregation with Having
Count the number of shop's grouped by Location from Shop_IsIn having the inventory amount greater than or equal to 50

SELECT LocationName, COUNT(ShopName) FROM Shop_IsIn GROUP BY LocationName HAVING InventoryAmount => 50

Division
Find the players (determined by PLayerID) that have bought an item from a store in all locations

SELECT p.PlayerID, p.PlayerUsername
FROM PlayerCharacter as p
WHERE NOT EXISTS(
          SELECT *
          FROM Location as l
          WHERE NOT EXISTS(
                    SELECT *
                    FROM BuysFrom as b
                    WHERE p.PlayerID = b.PlayerID AND
                    l.LocationName = b.LocationName

findPlayerConverses()
findAllPlayersWithLevelsUnder25()
countShopsByLocation()
findPlayersThatBoughtFromAllLocations()
